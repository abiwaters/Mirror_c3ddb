**My SSH key is not working:** 

First, make sure you are using the private key (ends with .ppk) and not the public key. 
Next, make sure that the read permissions are set appropriately with  
[username@ c3ddb01.mit.edu ~]$ chmod 777 SSHKEY.ppk
 
 
**I lost my passphrase or SSH key:** 

If you have forgotten your passphrase or deleted your SSH key, you will need to contact System Admins and generate a new private SSH key. Based on your operating system, this will differ. 
Once you have generated a new one, System Admins will be able to assist you in resetting your password.
