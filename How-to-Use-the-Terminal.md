Once logged into c3ddb, you will see a command prompt. The text prompt displayed to you is called the “terminal” and the program you interact with is called a “shell“. Inside each shell, you will communicate with the operating system and filesystem using “commands“. If you are already familiar with Linux commands and directory navigation, you can skip forward to [Job Submission](https://github.com/abiwaters/Getting-Started-on-c3ddb/wiki/How-to-Submit-a-Batch-Job). We have also provided some [resources](https://github.com/abiwaters/Getting-Started-on-c3ddb/wiki/Commands) for those who are not familiar with Linux commands, and outlined the [directory structure](https://github.com/abiwaters/Getting-Started-on-c3ddb/wiki/Cluster-Navigation).
